# goonbot5

Rewrite time!

## Goals
- Attach working database 💾
  - This would bring back mugging, gambling games, etc 🎰
- New translation _message command_ 🤩
- Implement new ✨ async ✨ LoL package to hopefully fix `/lastgame` once and for all 🤞
- New **eCelebs** cog 😎
  - If an eCeleb has more than one platform, a button appears asking for which one

### Reasons (another) rewrite
- It's fun 🤓
- New version project structure, making it easier for new to implement new features on the fly
- Specified package versions to prevent breakage
